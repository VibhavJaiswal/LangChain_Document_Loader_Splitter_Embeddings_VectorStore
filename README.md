# LangChain_Document_Loader_Splitter_Embeddings_VectorStore

LangChain Document Processing: Loaders, Splitters, Embeddings & VectorStore
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use LangChain for document loading, text splitting, embedding generation, and vector storage. The notebook processes real-world text data, including State of the Union transcripts and resumes, making it useful for applications such as document retrieval, semantic search, and NLP-based analysis.
ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Load text and PDF documents using TextLoader and PyPDFLoader.
âœ… Split large documents into smaller, manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
âœ… Generate text embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings and OpenAIEmbeddings.
âœ… Store vectorized data in a VectorStore for efficient retrieval and semantic search.
âœ… Practical NLP use cases including resume analysis, large document handling, and information retrieval.
